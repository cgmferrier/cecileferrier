            I have helped the team at Chatty Therapy on a few occasions. They needed my help to <span className="bold">implement</span> a game similar to the well known <span className="bold">Kim's game</span>.
            Three images chosen amongst a known set would be displayed randomly.
          </div>
          <div className="project-details">
            After the game has been started, one image would be hidden and three new images would then be displayed below the initial set.
            Out of these three images, the children would have to pick the correct one that had initially been displayed.

            My role as part of the Team at <span className="bold">Send</span>, was to help implement new features for their Workbench application directed to underwriters.
